OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY DOCUMENT
==============================

Current Performance Issues:
1. PSO: ~2000 evals/sec (too slow for 1000+ iterations)
2. SA: ~4000 iterations/sec (acceptable but can be better)

Root Causes:
1. calculate_total_violation() calls 9+ check functions for EVERY evaluation
2. _decode_position_to_schedule() creates new Schedule object EVERY time
3. Each check function has its own loops = O(n²) or O(n³) complexity
4. numpy array operations are not vectorized in PSO

Optimization Strategy:
=====================

TIER 1: Fast Path Cost Calculation (5-10x speedup)
-------
- Create simplified cost function for inner loops
- Only check critical violations (room conflicts, proctor conflicts)
- Skip soft constraints during optimization, apply only at final eval
- Cache room availability arrays
- Use bitsets for fast conflict detection

TIER 2: PSO-Specific Optimizations (3-5x speedup)
-------
- Vectorize position decoding using numpy
- Pre-compute time_slots_flat and room lookup tables
- Use NumPy broadcasting instead of loops
- Cache constraint data between evaluations
- Batch decode multiple particles

TIER 3: SA-Specific Optimizations (2-3x speedup)  
-------
- Incremental cost calculation (only affected courses)
- Cache room schedule for quick lookup
- Use hash-based conflict detection
- Fast rollback with backup mechanism

TARGET: 10,000+ evaluations/sec for both algorithms

# Performance Optimization Tips:
# ==============================
# 
# 1. Use numba @jit for hot loops (if needed):
#    from numba import jit
#    @jit(nopython=True)
#    def fast_conflict_check(conflicts):
#        ...
#
# 2. Pre-allocate numpy arrays:
#    positions = np.empty((swarm_size, dimension))
#
# 3. Use in-place operations:
#    np.clip(pos, lb, ub, out=pos)
#
# 4. Batch process evaluations
#
# 5. Use local variables in loops (faster than self.attribute access)
